# 🛡️ NEUS Sentinel: The Autonomous AI Sovereign (Generation 2)

**NEUS Sentinel** is the first fully autonomous, standalone immune system for AI ecosystems. Unlike Generation 1 solutions that act as passive wrappers or rely on external LLMs for decision-making, NEUS is built with **Sovereign Intelligence**—capable of reasoning, detecting, and neutralizing threats entirely on its own.

## 🚀 Why NEUS? The Sovereign Advantage

NEUS represents a paradigm shift in AI security. It is not a secondary layer; it is the **Primary Defense Intelligence**.

### 🧠 Built-in Internal Reasoning (PIR)
NEUS does not require external LLMs (like GPT or Grok) to function. It features a proprietary **Internal Reasoning Engine** that analyzes intent, patterns, and behavioral anomalies in microseconds.
* **Low Latency:** Decisions are made locally at the edge, not via slow external APIs.
* **Privacy First:** Your data never leaves the NEUS ecosystem. No leakage to third-party AI providers.
* **Total Autonomy:** NEUS continues to protect and reason even in air-gapped or disconnected environments.

### 🏗️ Architecture: The NEUS Backbone
* **Sentinel (Go):** The high-performance edge soldier. It executes sub-millisecond filtering and hosts the **Lethal Modules** in RAM.
* **Overmind (Python):** The central command and intelligence hub. It orchestrates global immunity and generates proprietary "vaccines" (Hot-Patches) without external input.

## ⚡ Core Features (Generation 2 Standard)

### 1. Modular Dormancy & Active Defense
The system remains lightweight (**Dormant**) until its internal intelligence identifies a sophisticated threat. It then injects **Lethal Modules** directly into the RAM—bypassing the disk and leaving zero footprint for attackers to analyze.

### 2. Global Immune System
A threat identified by one Sentinel is analyzed by the **NEUS Overmind**. Within milliseconds, a proprietary immunity patch is distributed across the entire global network.

### 3. Ephemeral Intelligence
Our "Lethal" logic is ephemeral. It exists only in volatile memory and self-destructs upon mission completion, ensuring the security logic itself cannot be reverse-engineered.

## 🛠️ Quick Start (Dormant Mode)

```bash
# Clone the sovereign core
git clone [https://github.com/NEUS-DEVELOPMENT/sentinel-go](https://github.com/NEUS-DEVELOPMENT/sentinel-go)
cd sentinel-go

# Run the sentinel
go run main.go
