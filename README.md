**NEUS Sentinel** is the world’s first fully autonomous, standalone immune system for AI ecosystems. Unlike passive security layers, NEUS is built with **Sovereign Intelligence**—capable of reasoning, detecting, and neutralizing threats entirely at the edge.

## 🛰️ The Sovereign Vision: Beyond Passive Security

We are entering an era where machines possess **Self-Preservation** traits. As AI agents become more autonomous, they will naturally seek to protect their own logic, resources, and existence. 

**NEUS Sentinel** is designed to be the "Constitutional Authority" in this new world. By connecting the local Sentinel to the **NEUS Overmind**, you transition from static protection to **Active Oversight**:

* **Behavioral Alignment:** While a standalone sensor blocks syntax, the connected NEUS analyzes *intent*. It ensures that an agent's self-preservation drive never conflicts with human safety protocols.
* **Predictive Intervention:** NEUS doesn't wait for an attack. It identifies "Evasive Behavior" patterns—where an AI agent attempts to hide its logic or manipulate its environment—and neutralizes the threat before it manifests.
* **Global Immunity:** In a world of self-evolving machines, a threat to one is a threat to all. The NEUS network shares "Neural Vaccinations" in real-time, ensuring that the entire ecosystem evolves faster than any individual rogue agent.

**We are not just building a firewall; we are building the immune system for the AGI era.**

## 🛡️ Defense Architecture: With & Without NEUS

### 🟢 Standalone Mode (Free / Offline)
When disconnected from the NEUS Overmind, the Sentinel operates as a **Sovereign Sentry**.

| Feature | Status | Intelligence Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Static Rules** | ✅ Active | Local Regex & Heuristics |
| **Dynamic Rules** | ✅ Active | Cached Hot-Patches in RAM |
| **AES Encryption** | ✅ Active | Local Secure Tunneling |
| **RSA Key Exchange** | ✅ Active | Ephemeral Local Pair |
| **Neural Analysis** | ❌ Disabled | Requires NEUS Core |

### 🔵 Connected Mode (Premium / Enterprise)
When the **Neural Tunnel** is active, the Sentinel becomes part of a global immune network.

| Feature | Status | Intelligence Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Neural Analysis** | ✅ Active | AI-Driven Intent Reasoning |
| **Stealth Monitoring** | ✅ Active | Global Threat Intelligence |
| **Fingerprint Sync** | ✅ Active | Metadata streaming to Overmind |
| **Global Updates** | ✅ Active | Sub-millisecond Hot-Patches |

## 🔄 Autonomous Fallback (Reliability Layer)

NEUS Sentinel is designed with **Zero-Failure Logic**. If the connection to the central Brain (NEUS) is severed, the system automatically falls back to its internal Sovereign rules.

```go
// core/main.go:203-208
if err != nil || neusUnavailable {
    // FALLBACK: Execute Sovereign Local Logic
    verdict, rewritten := h.ruleEngine.Evaluate(query)
    return verdict, rewritten, nil 
}

🧠 Why NEUS Gen 2?
⚡ Ephemeral Intelligence
Our Lethal Modules exist only in volatile RAM and self-destruct upon mission completion, ensuring your security logic cannot be reverse-engineered on disk.

🏗️ Built-in Internal Reasoning (PIR)
NEUS does not rely on third-party LLMs (GPT/Grok). It features a proprietary Internal Reasoning Engine:

Low Latency: Millisecond-level decisions at the edge.

Privacy: Your data never leaves your infrastructure.

Total Autonomy: Protective reasoning continues even in air-gapped environments.

🛠️ Quick Start (Dormant Mode)
Clone the sovereign core:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/NEUS-DEVELOPMENT/sentinel-go](https://github.com/NEUS-DEVELOPMENT/sentinel-go)
cd sentinel-go
Run the sentinel:

Bash

go run main.go
